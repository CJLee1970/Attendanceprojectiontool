A web-based tool to forecast student attendance, process batch uploads (CSV/Excel), and generate detailed PDF reports for parent engagement. Built with HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JS.
Attendance Projection Tool
An intuitive, client-side web application designed to help schools and attendance officers forecast end-of-year student attendance. This tool helps identify students at risk of becoming Persistently Absent (PA) and provides resources to support positive engagement with parents and carers.

Key Features:
Single Student Calculator: Quickly calculate an individual student's projected attendance based on their current percentage.

Batch Processing: Upload a CSV or Excel file (.csv, .xlsx) containing multiple students to process their attendance data in bulk.

Visual Feedback: Uses a clear, color-coded "traffic light" system to categorize attendance projections (Excellent, Good, Persistent Absence).

PDF Report Generation: Creates professional, A4-formatted PDF reports for individual students. These reports include key statistics, explanations, and actionable tips for parents, including NHS guidance on minor illnesses.

No Backend Required: Runs entirely in the browser using HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript, with libraries for handling files and PDF generation.
